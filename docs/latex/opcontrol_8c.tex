Runs the user operator control code. This function will be started in its own task with the default priority and stack size whenever the robot is enabled via the Field Management System or the V\+EX Competition Switch in the operator control mode. If the robot is disabled or communications is lost, the operator control task will be stopped by the kernel. Re-\/enabling the robot will restart the task, not resume it from where it left off.

If no V\+EX Competition Switch or Field Management system is plugged in, the V\+EX Cortex will run the operator control task. Be warned that this will also occur if the V\+EX Cortex is tethered directly to a computer via the U\+SB A to A cable without any V\+EX Joystick attached.

Code running in this task can take almost any action, as the V\+EX Joystick is available and the scheduler is operational. However, proper use of delay() or task\+Delay\+Until() is highly recommended to give other tasks (including system tasks such as updating L\+C\+Ds) time to run.

This task should never exit; it should end with some kind of infinite loop, even if empty.
